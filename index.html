    <h2>Introduction to Git</h2>
    Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is a free and open-source software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

    <hl>Why Use Git?</hl>
    <p>* Version Control: Git keeps track of every change made to the code, allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed. <br> * Collaboration: Git enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work. <br> * Backup: With Git, you can create backups of your project at any point in time. <br> * Branching: Git allows you to create branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.</p>
