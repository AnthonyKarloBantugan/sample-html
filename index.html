    <h2>Introduction to Git</h2>
    Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. It is a free and open-source software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005. Git is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

    <h2>Why Use Git?</h2>
<ul>
   <li>Version Control: Git keeps track of every change made to the code, allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed.</li>
   <li>Collaboration: Git enables multiple people to work on the same project simultaneously without interfering with each other’s work.</li>
   <li> Backup: With Git, you can create backups of your project at any point in time. </li>
    <li>Git allows you to create branches to work on new features without affecting the main project.</li>
