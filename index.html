        <h2>Introduction to Git</h2>
        Git is a distributed version control system designed to handle
        everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.
        It is a free and open-source software created by Linus Torvalds in 2005.
        Git is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be
        used to track changes in any set of files.

        <h2>Why Use Git?</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Version Control: Git keeps track of every change made to the code,
            allowing you to revert to any previous version if needed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Collaboration: Git enables multiple people to work on the same
            project simultaneously without interfering with each otherâ€™s work.
          </li>
